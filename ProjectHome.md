## The Unreadable Tumblr Theme ##
A Tumblr theme to prevent people who don't follow you from reading your posts, by not displaying them on your blog page. (Users who follow you can read your posts from their dashboards.)

This is useful for when Tumblr's 'block' feature does not provide enough restriction, for example if someone is getting harassed by a dedicated troll.

It displays only the blog title and description (if any is listed), and has an option to display a description of the theme and why the user has chosen it if they wish.
